## Synopsis

This web application helps you find nearest places like restaurants,ATM,doctors, hospitals, etc ,virtually anything around you or anywhere in seconds . 

The user has to enter the address of the location and the category of place he wants to find like doctors, restaurants , bank , police station, etc..
A search provides the top 30 results in any of the categories .

The search results include places within a radius of 2 kilometers sorted in the order of their importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the specified area. Prominence can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index, global popularity, and other factors.

This project was done using PHP as scripting language and Bootstrap and HTML as frontend . I used Google Places API and Google Maps API for fetching the results .
